    <h1>Data Annotation in the Era of LLMs - Thoughts and Good Practices</h1>
        The rise of large language models (LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges for data annotation in NLP. In this talk, I will explore the evolving role of LLMs as annotators, particularly in tasks involving subjectivity. I will present recent work that will also be presented in the conference on how to evaluate whether an LLM is a good annotator: "The Alternative Annotator Test for LLM-as-a-Judge: How to Statistically Justify Replacing Human Annotators with LLMs"—highlighting methods introduced in our paper—and discuss how LLMs compare to human annotators in consistency and reliability. I will also introduce new, unpublished research on best practices for identifying when and how LLMs can serve as reliable annotators for subjective NLP tasks. The talk aims to provide both theoretical insights and practical guidance for researchers and practitioners rethinking annotation pipelines in the LLM era.<br> <br>

        <h1>Engaging experts and LLMs in corpora development</h1>
        Large language models (LLMs) have become ever more capable, surpassing human performance on a number of tasks. Recent findings showed that LLMs can effectively replace traditional crowdsourcing to a large extent, and model training has increasingly been driven by synthetically generated data. These developments have triggered new questions about corpora development. This talk explores two of them: First, what type of human annotation can still be useful? I discuss our efforts engaging human expertise to effectively capture implicit reasoning in discourse and pragmatics, revealing weaknesses in existing models in those aspects. Second, how can we leverage LLMs to reveal task nuances that may be unknown before annotation? I present Explanation-Based Rescaling (EBR), a method that uses an LLM to rescale coarse-grained human ratings into consistent, fine-grained scores using natural language explanations from annotators, while discerning task subtleties embedded in these explanations.<br><br>
